		Some features are availabe only in the professional version of pestudio.
		The free version of pestudio may not be used in a professional environment.

		When retrieving the scores from Virustotal, pestudio NEVER submits 
		the sample itself! pestudio only submits the hash (MD5) of the 
		sample being analyzed.

		Several XML files are provided with pestudio. 
		Any usage of these XML files outside of the context of pestudio (e.g. in a third-party application, tools chain, etc...)
